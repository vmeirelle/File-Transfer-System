This is a file transfer system implemented in Python. The system consists of two components: a server that stores files in a cache and a client that can download files from the server or upload files to the server. The system supports multi-threading and caching of files on the server side, and provides a simple command line interface for the client.

##Architecture
The system uses a client-server architecture. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, and responds to requests for file transfers. The server stores files in a cache on disk, and provides clients with a list of available files in the cache. The client connects to the server and can download or upload files as needed.

##Technologies
The system is implemented in Python, using the built-in socket library for networking. The server uses multi-threading to handle multiple clients simultaneously. The server also caches files on disk using the os and shutil libraries.

##Protocols
The system uses a simple command line protocol to communicate between the client and server. The protocol supports three commands:

LIST: Returns a list of filenames available in the server's cache.
GET <filename>: Downloads a file from the server with the given filename.
PUT <filename>: Uploads a file to the server with the given filename.
Design Decisions
The system was designed with the following goals in mind:

Simplicity: The system should be easy to understand and use, with a minimalistic interface.
Scalability: The system should be able to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
Efficiency: The system should minimize network traffic and disk I/O.
Robustness: The system should be able to handle errors and recover gracefully.
To achieve these goals, the server uses a cache to minimize disk I/O and the client uses a simple protocol to minimize network traffic. The server also uses multi-threading to handle multiple clients simultaneously. The system includes error handling to handle common errors such as file not found or disk full.

##Solutions to Critical Problems
One of the critical problems in the system is ensuring thread safety when accessing the cache. To address this problem, the server uses a lock to ensure that only one thread can access the cache at a time.

Another critical problem is handling files that are too large to fit in the cache. To address this problem, the server fetches these files from disk when requested by the client, and does not store them in the cache.

Finally, the system must handle errors such as file not found, disk full, or network errors. The system includes error handling to handle these errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user.

##Conclusion
The file transfer system is a simple and efficient way to transfer files between clients and servers. The system uses a client-server architecture with a simple command line protocol to transfer files. The system is designed with simplicity, scalability, efficiency, and robustness in mind, and includes solutions to critical problems such as thread safety, handling large files, and error handling.
